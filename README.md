# Kohana 2.3.4 Rate Library

Fedex rate fetching library developed to use with Kohana 2.3.4 php framework. It uses the nusoap library to fetch rates. While this library was developed for Kohnana 2.3.4, it could be easily adopted to a number of different PHP platforms. Be sure to comb the `Fedex.php` and `Fedex_Rate.php` files for comments that indicate where you need to add information (account number, meter number), and Kohana specific code that needs changed or removed (isn't that much).
